## Objective
Help customers book a session with a specialist and have their records saved in their account on this site.
Customers would have data on their accounts with their results in sessions they booked, and they can also ask an AI for a fast Q&A that doesn't need a whole session for it.

## Languages
I am using the power of MERN stack in this application

## Usage
It can be variable but most probably it will be node app.js
